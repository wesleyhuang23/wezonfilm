when users come to the site they will see what is the latest film that is my favorite. As they scorll they will see 6 movies that I have recently reviewed along with a bio on who I am and what the site is about.

Clicking on a movie poster the user will be taken to the movie review page where there is a trailer and the review I wrote for the movie. As they scroll to the bottom there will be a simple movie info display. Users have the option to print the review with the print button. This is done, by using the imdb id that is given to the movie object.

# Library

The library is the collection of movies that I have seen. Stored in the SQL database. Users can search through the library with the search bar.

A collection of films that I think are stellar.
